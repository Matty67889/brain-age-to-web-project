      Once the game begins, numbers will appear on the
      screen for a couple seconds, and then turn into boxes.
      The goal is to click on the boxes in order of least
      to greatest number. If a box is chosen in the
      incorrect order, the round ends.

      <p>
        This game is a recreation of the game "Low to High"
        from the game Brain Age for the Nintendo DS. I do
        not claim any ownership of the original game.
        This version will allow users to customize the
        rules of the game, deviating from the original
        in this way. I was inspired to create this
        because I didn't see any online versions of
        Brain Age games on the Internet.
